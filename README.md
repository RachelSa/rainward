## Current Features:
 - Displays major cities in the US northeast, US northwest, CA east, and CA west with the most rainy, cold, and windy forecasts for the next four days.
 - Displays each destination's current temp and a short description of current conditions
 - Gives each destination a 'wool sock rating', depending on how rainy, cold, etc the forecast will be.
